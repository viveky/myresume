I've decided to make my resume in HTML/CSS, and I'm hosting it on GitHub
because GitHub is great.  You can find the resume in the following places:

* [Web Version](http://sjelin.github.io/resume)
* [PDF Version](http://sjelin.github.io/resume/Martin%20Samuel%20Jelin%27s%20Resume.pdf) (use this version for printing)

Please note that the web version was built for modern browsers and is best
viewed in either Chrome, Safari, iOS, or Android (though it has been tested
in Firefox and works alright there too).

Do not try to print the web version, it probably will not work.  It has been
configured to print properly on my computer in Chrome.  Getting printing to
work exactly how I want it to in multiple browsers is nearly impossible.

I'm using MIT license.  Not sure why you'd ever want to fork this but I'd be
honored if you did :D
